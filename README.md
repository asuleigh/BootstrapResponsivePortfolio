Amanda Surber's Responsive Portfolio README

ABSTRACT: This is a personal portfolio website created using Bootstrap. I have created this site in hopes that I will be able to continuously use it to improve my skills and for a place to showcase my public profile and work. (Aside: The current version is created to reflect the current assignment.)

i: INSTALLATION
-In order to clone or download website for functionality on local drives, be sure to install files to proper locations.

-index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html should be located in the source folder. The source folder should also contain an "Assets" folder.

-Inside of the "Assets" folder, make sure there is a "css" and an "images" folder

-Clone or download style.css to the "css" folder and and images available to the "images" folder

ii: USAGE
-Layout is as it appears. Links in Header work and so does the Submit button. Currently links are not set up for Portfolio.html (will be finishing set up within the next day) and messages will not redirect, though you can interact with the box. More will be added/finished in coming updates.
