      <img src="Assets/images/headshot.jpg" class="imgleft" alt= "Amanda Surber Headshot">
      <p> Originally from Southwestern Virginia, I moved to Charlotte, North Carolina three years ago after graduating from East Tennessee State University with a bachelor's degree in Music Edcuation. Since moving to Charlotte, my partner began to pursue his masters degree and I started a career in education. I have worked for the past three years in various Education positions. Although I have a degree in Music Education, I also studied to teach General Education for grades K-12, so I have worked as an English teacher, tutor, and test scoring supervisor. Though I enjoy this work, I have been wanting a change of environment and to take on a new challenge.
      
      <p>I have started the Coding: Full-Stack certificate program at University of North Carolina at Charlotte as I am looking to expand my skill sets and possibly change careers. I enjoy being creative and meticulous with my work. So far, coding has allowed me to learn new skills and use many of the skills and discipline that I gained from being an educator and studying education.
      

      <p>For me, studying to be a web developer has done more than just put me on a path to a new career, but it has also given me new confidence and a sense of accomplishment. I look forward to creating and collaborating in this new field and am excited for what the future holds!
